• Implemented detection logic and alert thresholds for brute force (4625), account creation (4720), and privilege escalation (4732).
• Correlated authentication abuse → account creation → admin group modification using MITRE ATT&CK techniques (T1098, T1484).
• Monitored Windows Event Logs and Sysmon telemetry for suspicious PowerShell and privilege escalation activity.
• Produced structured incident response documentation demonstrating full attack chain detection and endpoint correlation.
